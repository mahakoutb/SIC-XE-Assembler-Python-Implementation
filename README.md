* SIC/XE Assembler ‚Äì Python Implementation
This project is a Python-based assembler for the SIC/XE (Simplified Instructional Computer ‚Äì Extended) architecture. It processes assembly source code and generates object code in HTE (Header, Text, End) format, making it suitable for educational use, compiler labs, or system-level tool development.

üîë Key Functions
üîÅ pass1()
Builds the symbol table and assigns memory locations to each line in the source program.

üîÑ pass2()
Generates object codes for each instruction using proper format and addressing mode (immediate, indirect, PC-relative, base-relative, etc.).

üßæ HTE_Record()
Produces the HTE format output, including:

H (Header) record with program name, starting address, and length.
T (Text) records split into 30-byte segments.
M (Modification) records for format 4 instructions.
E (End) record with program starting address.
* Features
Two-pass assembler architecture.
Supports:
Instruction formats: Format 1, Format 2, Format 3, and Format 4.
Addressing modes: Immediate (#), Indirect (@), Indexed (,X), PC-relative, and Base-relative.
Uses a BASE directive for base-relative addressing.
Supports both numeric literals and symbolic labels.
* Output Example
H^XXCOPY^000000^001077 T^000000^1E^141033^681033^... M^001006^05 M^001014^05 E^000000

* Purpose
This assembler demonstrates the internal steps of converting assembly language into object code, mimicking real-world assembler behavior for SIC/XE systems. It's built for learning, experimentation, and modular enhancement.

* Educational Use
You can use this project to:

Understand how assemblers resolve symbols and addresses.
Practice implementing instruction decoding and encoding.
Generate and verify machine-level object code.
Explore base-relative and PC-relative addressing computations.
* Quick Start
Ensure you have:

A file Input.xlsx containing the source program.
A file OP_Code_ref.xlsx containing opcode reference data.
Run the notebook or script to:

python SICXE.ipynb

Algorithm ‚Äì SIC/XE Two-Pass Assembler

Load Input Data
1.1 Read opcode reference table (OP_Code_ref.xlsx).
1.2 Read assembly source program (Input.xlsx).
1.3 Normalize column names (Instruction, Reference).

Pass 1 ‚Äì Assign Addresses & Build Symbol Table
2.1 Initialize location_counter = 0.
2.2 For each instruction:
- Determine instruction Format from opcode table or directives.
- Increment location_counter according to format or directive size.
- Record the Location for the current line.
2.3 For each labeled line, add {label: location} to SymTable.

Pass 2 ‚Äì Generate Object Codes
3.1 Assign opcodes to instructions (ignore directives).
3.2 Format 1: Object code = opcode.
3.3 Format 2: Convert registers to numeric codes, build opcode+regs.
3.4 Directives: Mark No_Object_Code for RESB, RESW, START, END, BASE.
3.5 BYTE (hex): Remove X'...' and store hex value.
3.6 BYTE (char): Convert each char to ASCII hex.
3.7 WORD: Convert value to 6-digit hex.

Addressing Modes & Flags
4.1 Set N and I flags (immediate #, indirect @, or both).
4.2 Set X flag for indexed ,X.
4.3 Set B, P, E flags:
- Format 4: E=1, B=0, P=0.
- Format 3: PC-relative if displacement in range; else base-relative.
4.4 Calculate address/disp from symbol table or immediate constant.

Assemble Final Object Code
5.1 Combine opcode (6 bits) + flags (n,i,x,b,p,e) + address/disp into binary.
5.2 Convert binary to hex for final Object_Code.

Generate HTE Records
6.1 H Record: Program name, start address, length.
6.2 T Records: Object codes in 30-byte blocks.
6.3 M Records: For format 4 modifications.
6.4 E Record: Program starting address.

Output
7.1 Display symbol table, object codes, and HTE format output.
